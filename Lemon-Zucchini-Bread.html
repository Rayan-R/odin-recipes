        <h1>Lemon Zucchini Bread</h1>
        <img src="./images/image.webp" alt="Photo of Lemon Zucchini Bread">
        <h3>This zucchini bread is delicious, light, and not overly sweet.</h3>
        
        
        <p><strong>Lemon zucchini bread</strong> resembles a muffin and contains a hint of 
            cinnamon and sweetness. As in this recipe, it's frequently broken up 
            with delicate walnut pieces. You hardly even notice the taste of the
            zucchini because it is so mild. However, don't you find the tiny green
            flecks to be both fascinating and beautiful?</p>

            

            <p><h1>Ingreedients</h1></p>

            <ul>
                <li>1½ cups shredded zucchini</li>
                <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>

            </ul>
            <h1>Steps</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease an 8x4 
                inch loaf pan.</li>

                <li>In a bowl, beat together the zucchini, sugar, egg, and oil. 
                    In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, salt, baking soda,
                    and baking powder; stir in the cinnamon and lemon zest. Stir the
                    flour mixture into the zucchini mixture just until blended. 
                    Pour the batter into the prepared pan.</li>
                    
                <li>Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until a knife inserted in
                     the center comes out clean. Remove from heat, and cool about 10
                      minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
                    </li>
